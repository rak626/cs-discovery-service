Project Name: Distributed Event Ticketing and Booking System
Overview:
This is a robust, distributed platform for managing event ticket bookings. It handles high volumes of transactions during peak times (e.g., during event launches) and ensures real-time seat availability, secure payments, and seamless user experience. The system leverages microservices architecture, event-driven workflows, and distributed caching for scalability and fault tolerance.

Detailed Functional Requirements:
1. User Management:
   Roles:
   Admin: Create and manage events, users, venues, and reports.
   Organizer: Set up events, pricing, and monitor sales.
   Customer: Browse, book, and manage tickets.
   Features:
   User registration and login.
   OAuth2-based third-party login (Google, Facebook).
   Profile management for customers.
2. Event Management:
   Event Details:
   Name, description, date, time, location, ticket categories (VIP, General).
   Seat Mapping:
   Visual representation of available and booked seats.
   Dynamic pricing based on demand.
3. Ticket Booking:
   Real-time seat selection with instant locking during booking.
   Integration with Redis to temporarily reserve seats until payment confirmation.
   Confirmation on successful payment or release of seats on timeout.
4. Payment Processing:
   Secure payments via credit cards, UPI, wallets.
   Integration with popular payment gateways like Stripe or Razorpay.
   Payment retries and failure handling.
5. Notifications:
   Email/SMS confirmations for bookings, cancellations, and reminders.
   Event-driven notifications using Kafka.
6. Admin Dashboard:
   Manage events, users, and revenue.
   Monitor ticket sales and traffic analytics.
   Generate reports like sales summaries, user activity, and event trends.
7. Organizer Portal:
   Create and edit events.
   View sales data and customer demographics.
   Download detailed reports.
8. Customer Portal:
   Browse events by category, location, or date.
   View event details, seat availability, and pricing.
   Manage bookings and request refunds.
9. Real-Time Updates:
   WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live seat availability updates.
   Redis for fast data retrieval during peak loads.
10. Fraud Prevention:
    CAPTCHA for suspicious booking patterns.
    Limit simultaneous bookings per user or IP.
    System Architecture:
1. Microservices:
   API Gateway: Centralized entry point for routing requests and authentication.
   Auth Service: Manages user authentication and JWT token issuance.
   Event Service: Handles event creation, updates, and management.
   Booking Service: Manages seat availability, reservations, and payments.
   Payment Service: Processes payments and updates booking statuses.
   Notification Service: Listens to booking events and triggers notifications.
   Analytics Service: Aggregates event and sales data for reports.
2. Database Design:
   Relational Database (PostgreSQL):
   Tables for users, events, bookings, payments, and venues.
   NoSQL Database (MongoDB):
   Store event metadata, logs, and seat maps.
   Redis:
   Temporary reservation cache.
   Real-time seat availability.
3. Event-Driven Architecture:
   Kafka for managing events like:
   Booking creation.
   Payment confirmation.
   Notifications.
   Tech Stack:
   Backend:
   Spring Boot: Core framework for building RESTful APIs.
   Spring Cloud: Service registry (Eureka), configuration management, and resilience.
   Redis: Distributed caching and session management.
   Kafka: Event-driven architecture.
   Database:
   PostgreSQL: Relational database for core business data.
   MongoDB: NoSQL for storing seat mappings and large datasets.
   Frontend (optional for full-stack):
   React.js or Angular: Build the customer and admin dashboards.
   Other Tools:
   Docker & Kubernetes: Containerization and orchestration.
   ELK Stack: Centralized logging and debugging.
   Prometheus & Grafana: Monitoring and alerting.
   Data Flow:
   Booking Process:

User selects seats and proceeds to checkout.
Booking Service checks seat availability (Redis cache).
Seats are temporarily reserved in Redis.
User completes payment via Payment Service.
On payment confirmation:
Redis reservation is finalized in the database.
Kafka event triggers Notification Service for email/SMS confirmation.
Seat Availability:

Seat statuses are updated in Redis and broadcasted via WebSockets.
Event Updates:

Organizer edits an event in the Event Service.
Changes are propagated to Booking and Analytics Services through Kafka.
Challenges & Solutions:
1. Concurrency in Seat Selection:
   Problem: Multiple users selecting the same seat.
   Solution: Redis locks for real-time reservation and a fallback mechanism to release unused locks.
2. High Traffic Handling:
   Problem: Sudden traffic spikes during popular event launches.
   Solution: Autoscaling microservices with Kubernetes and caching static data.
3. Payment Failures:
   Problem: Payments fail but seats remain reserved.
   Solution: Expire Redis reservations after a timeout and allow retry.
4. Data Consistency:
   Problem: Ensuring consistency across distributed services.
   Solution: Use Kafka to guarantee eventual consistency.
   Deployment:
   Environment Setup:
   Staging and production environments.
   CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
   Load Testing:
   Tools like Apache JMeter or Gatling for testing peak loads.
